1- language (python or R)

	a- data wrangling
	b- visualisation
	c- web scraping

2- Database

3- statistics
	a- hypothesis testing?
	b- conference interval
	c- p-value
	d- CLT
	e- distributions
	f- F-score
	g- data types (numeric : [continues, discrete],
				   catagorical: [ordinal, nominal])
	h- ANOVA
	i- outliers
	j- mean, median, mode, sd, variance, correlation.
	k- distance (euclidian, manhaten, etc..)
	l- difrence between t and z tests
	m- probability
	n- bootstraping


4- statistical learning algorithms
	a- baseline model(in regression the mean of the target variable, and in the classification the most accout value in target variable)
	b- supervised vs unsupervised learning
	c- regression vs classification
	d- interpret linear regression coefficients (for both numerical and factor vairbles)
	e- how we treat catagorical variblaes in linear regression?
	f- after linear regression trainining say we get this equasion (20 + age*17 + height*2 + is_merriedYes*1.7), interpret this.
	g- loss function
	h- least squares
	i- variable selection
	j- multicolinearity
	k- ensambling
	l- Dimension Reduction Methods
	m- variables transformation
	n- overfitting / under fitting
	o- bias and variance trade off
	p- complexity and interpretablity tradeoff
	q- ROC Curves
	r- cross validation, OOCV, k-fold
	s- how we tune or models?
	t- how models works?
		regression
			linear (including polynomial, step functions, Regression Splines, .. etc)
				Shrinkage Methods(Ridge Regression, The Lasso)
			Trees
			KNN
		classification
			logistic
			Trees
			LDA
			KNN
			SVM
