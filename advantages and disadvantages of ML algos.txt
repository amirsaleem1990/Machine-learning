Decision Tree:
	1- Easy to Understand
    2- Useful in Data exploration: Decision tree is one of the fastest way to identify most significant variables and relation between two or more variables.
    3- Decision trees implicitly perform variable screening or feature selection.
    4- Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation.
    5- Less data cleaning required: It requires less data cleaning compared to some other modeling techniques. It is not influenced by outliers and missing values to a fair degree.
    6- Data type is not a constraint: It can handle both numerical and categorical variables. Can also handle multi-output problems.
    7- Non-Parametric Method: Decision tree is considered to be a non-parametric method. This means that decision trees have no assumptions about the space distribution and the classifier structure.
    8- The number of hyper-parameters to be tuned is almost null.
